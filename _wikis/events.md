##### Hamfests
Hamfests are the signature amateur radio event. They are a style of flea market event were people from local and far away come to sell their old equipment and buy new gear.

##### LinuxFests
Linux themed events. We may attend because we have an interest in Linux applications and they often have amateur radio involvement.

##### On-Air Events
On-Air events do not have a physical location. While we may meet up somewhere, these events are generally on-air only.
