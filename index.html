			<h4>What is Amateur Radio?</h4>
			<p>
				Amateur Radio is a hobby that is enjoyed across the nation and the world. One of the primary purposes of Amateur Radio is emergency preparednessâ€”in the event of a natural disaster, often the only available form of communication is via radio. Amateur Radio Operators assist in this by providing necessary communications as a public service.
