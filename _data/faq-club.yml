  question:   1. What is Amateur Radio?
  answer:      Amateur Radio is a hobby enjoyed across the nation and the world. One of the primary purposes of Amateur Radio is emergency preparednessâ€”if a natural disaster occurs, often the only available form of communication is via radio. Amateur Radio Operators aid in this by supplying necessary communications as a public service.
